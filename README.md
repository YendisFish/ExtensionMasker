# Extension Masker

Just a proof of concept that you can insert a unicode character into
a filename that makes an executable look like any other type of file
in windows.

I suggest Windows fixes this immedietly... It is not a hard fix at all.

THIS IS UNTESTED ON LINUX! I HAVE NO CLUE IF IT WORKS OR NOT!
